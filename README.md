# **Limitless Translate**

## *Problem Statement*
I recently realised that no other page or app provided the facility of translating texts above 5000 characters so I created a silly but smart way of translating texts which are too long.

Generally google translate does not allow translation of content above 3900 caharacters - google translate (web) & 5000 characters - google translate app

I created a website which takes input of your texts and creates web-text page in seperate tab this makes it possible to use in-built browser translation and overcome the limitation of 3900/5000 characters imposed on users.

I saw this problem faced by my mother when she receives whatsapp messages which are long and in other language and which cannot be entirely translated by google app.
